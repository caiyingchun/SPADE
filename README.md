I will get some Applications, Databases, and Systems up soon.


##### Linux:

SPADE requires python-tk, python-vtk, python-numpy, and python-scipy. 

[Here](https://danieleriksson.net/2017/02/08/how-to-install-latest-python-on-centos/) are instructions for setting up a good Python build on CentOS/RH. Similar installs will work on other Linux flavors. 

##### Windows:

Windows installer [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/spade/).
