MolecularViewer and MolecularSystem are stable.

SPADE loads MolecularViewer objects and adds a tabbed 
space underneath where Applications are loaded. Most 
contributions are expected to be Applications, where 
a developer creates a Tkinter GUI to access their code. 
Developers upload to github and users download the 
Application, through SPADE, either at cost or free.
